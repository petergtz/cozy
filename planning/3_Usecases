Incr Backup:
mounten mit dependency: mount timestamp date based_on date
timestamp can exist in db already, but must have no backups based on this!
if it has successors, mount must fail
based_on must exits of course

mount based_on date
this is a readonly mount. no changes can be made ==> restore only
