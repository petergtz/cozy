Configuration
==============

Until now the only way to configure cozy is to edit ~/.cozy manually. 
Therefore copy the .cozy file from this directory into your home directory and adjust everything.

Note: So far, only a single path can be set up for backup.

For the specified target path make a file system in this directory:

./cozy-mkfs.py /path/to/your/full/target/directory <a unique backup-id number>


Usage:
=======

Whenever it's time to back up your data execute:

./cozy-backup.py


Whenever you need your backed up data open the source folder you specified in
 ~/.cozy in Nautilus and hit the "Go To Restore Mode" button. Find the file 
you're looking for and copy it to the desired location.

Important: Don't forget to close the Restore mode, otherwise the temporarily mounted cozyfs will not be unmounted.

Note: due to some restriction of plugins in Nautilus moving through the versions of folders
in Nautilus, Nautilus' window will be closed and immediately reopened with the new version.
Will be improved in the future.



Things that happen internally
==============================

Backup
-------

Executing cozy-backup.py
- will mount the filesystem from target dir into a temporary directory
- it will then sync this temporary directory with the source
- then it will unmount the filesystem
- and finally make a snapshot

Restore
--------

If you start restore mode in Nautilus
- the target directory will be mounted into a temporary directory
- nautilus will move into this directory
