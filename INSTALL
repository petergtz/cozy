Installation Instructions
==========================

Open a terminal and cd to current directory. Then type:
	make
	make install

The first line will download nautilus, apply patches needed for Cozy and build it.
The second line will install all Nautilus and Cozy files.

WARNING: if you have Nautilus already installed, this will OVERWRITE your current Nautilus installation!

If you want to install it in a different directory, you can change the first line of the Makefile accordingly. In this case, make sure that you adjust all the necessary system paths as well.

For dependencies of Cozy and Nautilus, please have a look at the DEPENDECIES file.
