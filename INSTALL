Install-Instructions for Local Install
=======================================

Execute local-install.sh from the command line. No superuser needed.
This will install the cozy icons.

You need a patched version of nautilus. The patch is in the nautilus-patch
directory. Download nautilus 2.28.1, apply this patch within the source directory
and build it from source.

Now replace /usr/bin/nautilus by your freshly built version.
